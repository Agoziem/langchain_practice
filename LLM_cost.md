Absolutely — let's break it down clearly:

### 💰 LLM API Pricing: "Per 1M Tokens"

When you use an LLM via **API** (like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.), you are billed based on **how many tokens** you send in ("input") and how many tokens the model returns ("output"). The term **1M tokens** means **1 million tokens**.

### 🧾 Example Pricing (based on your input):

| Type   | Cost per 1M tokens | Explanation                  |
| ------ | ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| Input  | **\$0.30**         | What you send to the model   |
| Output | **\$2.50**         | What the model responds with |

### 🔍 What Are Tokens?

Tokens are **chunks of text**, not full words.
For English:

* "ChatGPT is smart" → \~4 tokens
* A full page of text (500–750 words) → \~750–1000 tokens
* 1 million tokens ≈ \~700,000 words

---

### 💡 Example Scenario

You use the API to:

* Send **10,000 tokens** of instructions (input)
* Receive **5,000 tokens** as a reply (output)

**Cost:**

* Input: 10,000 / 1,000,000 × \$0.30 = **\$0.003**
* Output: 5,000 / 1,000,000 × \$2.50 = **\$0.0125**

📌 **Total cost: \$0.0155** for this interaction

### 🧠 Why Output Is More Expensive

* Generating high-quality responses uses more compute resources
* Output is where most of the LLM’s intelligence (and cost) is concentrated
